# Coffee-Sales-Project

This coffee sales project involves utilizing Excelâ€™s robust features to transform raw data into actionable insights. By integrating data from orders, customers, and products tables, I implemented advanced Excel functions such as lookups, INDEX MATCH, and others to ensure accurate data merging for comprehensive reporting.  I applied meticulous formatting techniques to enhance the clarity and presentation of sales data, enabling effective communication of insights to stakeholders.  I also designed and developed an interactive dashboard using pivot charts, slicers, timelines, and other features to provide dynamic visualizations of coffee sales metrics and trends.
